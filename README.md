# Project-Euler
The collection of scripts I used to solve question from Project Euler. Not everything is here: 314 gets it's own repo, and some other questions I've been eyeing up will get their own if they're difficult and what I accomplish in them feels worth showing off. 

I mean, 314 took a couple of attempts, the final attempt was inspired when I was reading into Tikhonov regularization for smooth differentiation of data, required reading a couple of mathematic journal papers, and an analytical jacobian that didn't rely on recursion (only numpy array manipulation). Number 1 did not require any of that and took like 5 minutes with no optimising or mindfulness required for it to execute within the century. The two are definitely not on the same level.
